        <p>
          The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting rule that divides your
          after-tax income into three categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants,
          and 20% for savings.

        <h1>How does Smart Spend work?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          SmartSpend allows you to input your financial transactions and
          categorize them as needs, wants, or savings. It then generates a chart
          that shows your spending in each category and helps you stay within
          the 50/30/20 rule. It will then give a recommendation on how to adjust
          your spending to meet the 50/30/20 rule.
