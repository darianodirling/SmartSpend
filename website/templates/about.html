        SmartSpend is a financial management tool that helps you track your
        expenses and manage your budget using the 50/30/20 rule.

    <div class="question">
      <h1>What is the 50/30/20 rule?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting rule that divides your after-tax
        income into three categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for
        savings.

      <h1>How does Smart Spend work?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>
        SmartSpend allows you to input your financial transactions and
        categorize them as needs, wants, or savings. It then generates a chart
        that shows your spending in each category and helps you stay within the
        50/30/20 rule. It will then give a recommendation on how to adjust your
        spending to meet the 50/30/20 rule.
